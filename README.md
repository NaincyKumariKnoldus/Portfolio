# My Portfolio ðŸŒ¸

Challenge: 02: HTML and CSS

This is a personal project to create a professional portfolio for future employers.

Click to view the [deployed application](https://dieterichelizabeth.github.io/Portfolio/)

The project is geared towards the perspective of a future hiring manager in that-

```
"GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport"
```

To complete this challenge, I created the HTML document and stylesheet to display the necessary information, then created github issues to mark needed improvements to the code. The project adapts to screen sizes of 980px, 786px, and 575px.
